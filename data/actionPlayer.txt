You strike the enemy !
You obliterate one of their crewmates using a cannonball. 
You brace for impact ! 
You shield yourself, you coward.
You throw a cow at the enemy ship. 
How did this work ? Why a cow ? Who cares, it works.
You missed their ship, the cow drowns. You monster.
You send your best engineer to fix your ship. 
Who knew duct tape would work that well ?
Your engineer set themselves on fire trying to weld something. Your BEST engineer.
